# Heart-Stroke-Prediction

In the heart stroke prediction problem we would be working with the heart disease data and predicting the chances of a person to suffer from stroke respectively. 

We would be performing data preprocessing which is really important for machine learning and deep learning. The data is being converted to different mathematical vectors so that those values could be given to machine learning models for prediction respectively.
